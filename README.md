# TIC TAC TOE ❌⭕
A nice basic game which includes 3 files. Both 'main.py' and 'app.py' are two player game while 'ai_match.py' is just an experiment in which 2 AI place their symbols on a random place. It was to check if first turn player has a higher chance of winning or not. 'app.py' as it's name suggests, is an app where both users can play on a nice and organized GUI.
